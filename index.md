# Gesture Controlled Car
In this project, I make an RC Gesture Controlled Car. The car is controlled using a glove on my hand and can be controlled to go forward, backward, and turn left and right. It also has an ultrasonic sensor on it, allowing it to take measurements and display them to an lcd screen.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was getting the car to be able to move. This involved learning how the ESP32 works, getting it to work with the L298N motor driver, building the car chassis, and mounting and wiring up the 4 DC motors. I also wrote the code for the ESP32, motor driver, and motors to work.  One issue I had was figuring out how to code for the use of the pwm signal, and also how to control the direction while using that signal. In the end, the parts I used for this milestone were an ESP32, one L298N motor driver, 4 DC motors, 4 AA batteries, the battery pack, the car chassis kit, and a screwdriver.
